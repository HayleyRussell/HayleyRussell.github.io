                    I am a digital media professional with a strong background in managing and enhancing various sports organizations' online presence and fan engagement. Currently serving as the Manager of Digital Media for Sporting Kansas City since April 2022, I have spearheaded digital media strategies that have significantly increased fan engagement and brand visibility. Utilizing platforms such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud, YinzCam, Meta, and Vozzi, I reached over 43 million fans in 2023. My efforts in personalized email marketing campaigns have led to an increase in average open rates and have successfully boosted user engagement on the Sporting KC app. Additionally, the new SMS marketing initiative has enhanced brand awareness and sales. I love my job and feel so lucky that I get to work in sports and see how my efforts directly impact sales numbers and the education of fans in the stands.

                    Prior to my current role, I served as the Digital Marketing Manager for FC Cincinnati. In this capacity, I was responsible for directing the development and maintenance of FCCincinnati.com. One of my key achievements was leading a major CMS transition to meet new MLS guidelines, a project that required strong leadership and project management skills. I also oversaw the introduction of live streaming for matches and interactive fan engagement activities, which significantly enhanced the fan experience. My role also involved overseeing the production of engaging digital content, including news articles, videos, and graphics, to maximize fan interaction and the team's online presence.

                    My career in digital media began as the Email Marketing Coordinator for Mizzou Athletics. In this role, I developed and implemented a comprehensive digital marketing calendar that helped various departments and 17 different sports teams maximize their digital outreach and engagement. One of my key contributions was the analysis of email campaigns, which provided valuable leads to ticketing sales, premium sales, and fundraising teams. This experience showcases my ability to drive results through data-driven strategies and make informed decisions based on analytics.

                    I am an MBA student focusing on Marketing Analytics at the University of Missouriâ€“Columbia with an expected graduation date of May 2025. I hold a Bachelor of Journalism in Strategic Communications, with a minor in Psychology from Mizzou. My extensive technical skills include knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office, Salesforce, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Google Analytics, Meta, Tableau, website management, SMS texting platforms, and app development.

                    My career trajectory and hard work demonstrate dedication to leveraging digital media and marketing analytics to enhance fan and brand engagement and drive organizational success. I hope to one day be the director of Digital Marketing and young digital marketing leaders through the processes I've been through.
