        <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p> 
            Hi, I'm Hayley! I am a proud 2018 graduate of the Mizzou Journalism School. While there I earned my degree in Journalism - Strategic Communications. I am enrolled in the MBA - Marketing Analytics program at Mizzou and will graduate in Spring 2025!
            Outside of work and school, I am a runner who enjoys the mental calmness following a long run. I also love spending time with my corgi-lab mix, Lilo, who always brings joy, laughter and excitement. You can also find me hanging out with friends or at a local book club when I'm not running or playing with Lilo! 
            Looking ahead, I am eager to continue advancing my career in digital marketing, with a focus on enhancing user engagement through innovative email and website strategies. My goal is to use my experiences and education to drive impactful <strong>impactful</strong> marketing campaigns that resonate with audiences and achieve measurable results.
